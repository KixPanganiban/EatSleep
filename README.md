EatSleep
========

A *work-in-progress* food, workout, and sleep logging mini Django project for data nerds.

Log your caloric intake and burns, and see them in clean tables and charts (powered by HighCharts).

- **Feb 18, 2016**:
    Seven-day logs and chart for sleep are now integrated as well. Food intake can now also be logged.

- **Feb 17, 2016 (first commit)**:
    Currently, you can navigate by day but only view logs and charts for food. All input must be done in Django admin for now (powered by Django Suit).
